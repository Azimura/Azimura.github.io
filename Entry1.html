		<h2> Summary </h2>
		<p>
		Entry 1 is an entry that talks about challenges that had occurred while doing projects/assignments during the first semester of my sophomore year. The entry also talks about how I was able
		to overcome these challenges and how I grew from them.
		</p>
		<br />
		<div id="Entry1">
		<h2> Entry 1 </h2>
		<p>
		Throughout the first semester, I had to overcome many different challenges that range from some minor challenges to major challenges in all of the classes. 
		These challenges helped me grow as a student, and most of the time I was able to overcome these challenges with relative ease. 
		However, if I were to pick out two classes that I had trouble overcoming challenges in, it be Language Arts and Biology. 
		In these classes and specifically through the challenges in those two classes, I have learned how to improve my writing skills and my ability to study and retain information. <br /> <br />
		
		A challenge that I had to overcome in Language Arts came when I was doing the Individualist role project. 
		The Individualist role project was a project in which we had to write an objective essay answering the question, “What is a role of an individual in society?” using the reading given to us in class. 
		We also had to create something, whether that be a short story, PowerPoint, painting, etc., that showed our view on the question.
		When writing my essay, I had trouble creating an essay that was cohesive and easy to read and understand. Throughout the essay, I had to use information from the resources given to me. 
		However, when trying to use the information from the sources, I had always used direct quotes from the resources. 
		This, however, interrupted the flow of my essay because these quotes would tend to be 2-4 sentences. 
		It also made my essay sound very monotone because I would also have to say, “In page etc. author’s name said quote.” or something similar to it before every quote. 
		Snice I had to use many quotes from my resources in order to prove my point in the essay, this made my essay sound repetitive and boring, and could take the reader’s focus away from the topic of the essay. 
		In order to overcome this challenge, I had to learn how to paraphrase. Paraphrasing was not something new that I had just learned this year, but I never really knew how to effectively use it. 
		When I got critique on my essay when meeting with my Language Arts teacher, she told me that I should paraphrase some of the quotes. She told me that in order to paraphrase, 
		I should read the quote and try to find the main idea of the quote, and then I had to rewrite the quote in a shorter form. After learning how to paraphrase, 
		I was able to shorten my essay and was able to keep my reader engaged onto the essay without being interrupted by long quotes. <br /> <br />
		
		Another project in Language Arts that I struggled in was the epilogue/prologue project. 
		In this project, we had to pick a short-story that we had read in class and create a prologue or epilogue that could realistically happen before or after the story. 
		We also had to recapture the author’s tone and dictation from the original story and try to recreate it as best as we could in the prologue/epilogue. 
		For this project, I chose to create a prologue for the short-story “A Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allen Poe. In order to capture Poe’s tone and dictation,
		I had to read and analyze “A Tell-Tale Heart” and try to figure out how he explains stuff and narrates the story. 
		I learned the Poe narrates the story in a first-person view but instead of dialogue, he uses the description of the setting and the thoughts of the protagonist in order to tell the story. 
		When I tried to recreate this style of writing inside of my prologue, I would be too focused on trying to narrate the story through thoughts and event, 
		but I would forget about the tone of the story and details of events that happen within the story. 
		As a result, the prologue was able to capture the dictation of Poe but the story did not flow properly.
		There were many details within the events that I had overlooked, so when you read the story there were many discrepancy. 
		This may also be a result in my lack of knowledge about certain things snice I did immigrate to the US. In order to overcome this challenge, I had to learn how to proofread. 
		I had to closely analyze every single part of my story to see if it had made sense to me. If I were ever unsure about something, 
		I had to make sure that I asked either my teacher or my peers for help. I had also asked one of the friends to proofread through my story many times to see if the story had made sense to him. <br /><br />
		
		In Biology, the thing that challenge me the most did not come from a project like the previous two, but rather the challenge came from the class itself. 
		In the past year, science had always been a subject that I was able to easily understand. This year, however, it was slightly different.
		Biology as a subject was not that hard to understand but it was very hard to remember most of the terms and topics. 
		I was able to understand most of the topics that we talked about, but since there were many different topics and term that we had talked about I found it hard to remember all of them. 
		In order to better remember the topics and terms, I had to learn new study skills. I had to practice a lot more with my peers quizzing them on certain terms and topics while they do the 
		same to me. I had to use websites that helped me study such as Quizlet. I also had to learn how to take detailed and short notes so I could glance over my notes and would be able to 
		understand the topic/term again. <br /><br />
		
		Throughout the first semester, all of my classes had challenged me. I talked about 3 examples 2 from Language Arts and one from Biology, 
		but my other classes also had their fair share of challenges. These challenges helped me grow in my weak areas while also strengthening my strong areas. 
		The first semester of my sophomore year had taught me a lot and I have no doubts that my second semester will also teach me a lot. <br /><br />
