		<h2> Genius Hour driving Question </h2>
		<p> My Genius Hour driving Question was "How do each indiviudal part of a computer help a computer run? How do each individual part of a supercomputer help a supercomputer run? What is the difference between a normal computer and a supercomputer?"</p>
		<div id="computer">
		<h2> Computer Summary </h2>
		<img src="./Images/Computer.png"width="150px"height="98px">
		<p> Computers are machines that we everyday in our lives whether it's at work, at school, or at home. Computers are made up of 8 basic component the CPU, the GPU, the Hard drive, the RAM, the PSU, the computer case, the motherboard, and the Optical drive. An average computer cost a few hundred dollar while super fancy computer could cost a few thoudsand dollar. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="supercomputer">
		<h2> Supercomputer Summary </h2>
		<img src="./Images/Supercomputer.jpg"width="150px"height="92px">
		<p>Supercomputer are just computer that is more in every single way, meaning larger in size, produces more heat, uses alot more electricity, but luckly it's also alot faster than regular computer. For comparsion a regular computer could have around 2-4 cores while a supercomputer has can a couple hundred thousands. A regular cost for a supercomputer is at least 100 million dollar and the maintence for one could cost even more.</p>
		</div>
		<h2> Main Computer Parts </h2>
		<p> As stated above, there are 8 main parts of a computer. These parts are the computer case, the motherboard, the CPU, the GPU, the RAM, The Hard-drive, The PSU, and the Optical-drive </p>
		<div id="case">
		<h2> Computer Case </h2>
		<p> The Computer case is where every component in your computer lives, it is the home of all computer part and acts like one. It give safety from outside harm and it give ventilation to cool down the computer. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="motherboard">
		<h2> Motherboard </h2>
		<p> The motherboard is the components that connect all of the other components together through a circuit board. Everything in the computer which includes the CPU, RAM, GPU, PSU, hard-drive, printers, and the optical-drive are connected to the motherboard. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="CPU">
		<h2> CPU </h2>
		<p> The CPU is like the brain of the hardware, it tells the every other part of the computer what to do and control its. The CPU has two parts to it. the ALU (Arithmatic Logical Unit) and the control unit. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="GPU">
		<h2> GPU </h2>
		<p> The GPU does calculation to show you the graphics on the computer. Some newer version can also do some of the calculation for the CPU so the CPU can just focus on directing the computer what to do.</p>
		</div>
		<p> &nbsp; </p>
		<p> &nbsp; </p>
		<div id="RAM">
		<h2> RAM </h2>
		<p> RAM also known as Memory is where data is stored temporary for the CPU or the GPU to quickly access rather than accessing the hard-drive which is slower. However there are some disadvantage to the RAM as it can store very little and the data on the RAM will get deleted after the computer shuts down.  </p>
		</div>
		<div id="hard-drive">
		<h2> Hard-drive	</h2>
		<p> The Hard-drive is similar to the RAM in the fact that both stores data, however the Hard-drive stores more data than the RAM but is slower at accessing the data and importing and exporting the data. Data on the Hard-drive doesn't get deleted when the computer is shut-down so this is where most of the files on your computer is stored. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="PSU">
		<h2> PSU </h2>
		<p> The PSU (Power Supply Unit) supplys electricity to all of the computer parts by turning alternate current into direct current. Then the direct current is taken and distributed to the other computer parts through the motherboard. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="optical-drive">
		<h2> Optical-drive </h2>
		<p> The final part in the computer is called the Optical-drive. This is where you plug in external stuff such as USB, disks, and thumb-drive. The Optical drive will then read and interpet the data from the item, after reading the data the Optical-drive can either import more data into the item or export data from the item. </p>
		</div>
		<table>
			<caption> Data Storage parts comparison </caption>
			<tr><td></td><th>Speed</th><th>Storage Size</th></tr>
			<tr><th>Register</th><td>Fastest</td><td>Very Small</td></tr>
			<tr><th>RAM</th><td>Fast</td><td>Small</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Hard-drive</th><td>Slow</td><td>Largest</td></tr>
		</table>
		<div id="secondary">
		<h2> Secondary Computer Parts </h2>
		<p> These computer parts not crucial to a computer but can improve the computer performance greatly, or they are going into specifics of each of the main parts. </p>
		<div id="control-unit">
		<h2> Control Unit </h2>
		<p> As stated above the CPU has two parts to it, and one of them is the control unit. The Control Unit as the name states is the part of the CPU that tells the computer what to do. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="ALU">
		<h2> ALU </h2>
		<p>The ALU stands for Arithmetic Logical Unit and it does some basic number comparsion and then take action based on those numbers. Although some newer version may not of the ALU due to the GPU taking over doing the calculations.</p>
		<br />
		</div>
		<div id="cooling">
		<h2> Cooling system </h2>
		<p> Most computer nowadays have a form of cooling system, the two most common way of cooling in a computer is air-cooled by fans or water-cooled by water. This keeps the computer from overheating and can increase the performance speed of the computer. </p> 	
		</div>
		<center>
		<img src="./Images/cpuprocess.png" width="230px" height="219px"alt="A diagram of the Control Unit and the ALU working together">
		<p> How the ALU and the Control Unit work together </p>
		</center>
		</div>
		<h2> Types of Supercomputer </h2>
		<p> there are 4 types of supercomputer that are being built in the US, silicon-based, quantum, DNA, and Optical. </p>
		<div id="silicon">
		<h2> Silicon-based Supercomputer </h2>
		<p> Silicon-based Supercomputer are supercomputer that are built with copper,aluminum, and carbon connection that are between silicon-based components. Electrons travel through these connection which due to electrons having mass with limit the speed of the computers. Also, when the electrons travel through the computer it will generate alot of heat which causes the supercomputer to become very hot. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="quantum">
		<h2> Quantum Supercomputer </h2>
		<p> Quantum Supercomputers are supercomputers that are built to use quantum computing which is a mixture of quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum computers are slowly being devloped so there is alot to learn about quantum computer. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="DNA">
		<h2> DNA Supercomputer </h2>
		<p> DNA Supercomputers are supercomputers that are bulit under the same rules as living organism meaning as it lives it grows. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="optical">
		<h2> Optical Supercomputer </h2>
		<p> Optical Supercomputer are supercomputers that utilize light instead of electricity due to light being able to move through space and fiberoptic cable faster than an electron, and due to this speed optical computers are much can do stuff alot faster than silicon-based computer and it also doesn't generate as much heat as silicon-based supercomputer. Optical computers can also process billions of bit at a time compare to one bit at a time. </p>
		</div>
		<h2> Comparing Computers and Supercomputers </h2>
		<p> Although a supercomputer is a variation of a computer there are many differences between them, but they also have some similarities. </p>
		<div id="similarities">
		<h2> Similarities </h2>
		<p> Both types of computers have most of the same computer parts with the exception of the GPU that usually not in supercomputers, but is being currently implemented into supercomputers for energy efficiency. </p>
		<p> Supercomputers and Computer can both run the same OS as each other </p>
		<p> Both supercomputer and computer are built to interpret data and create data and do calculation </p>
		<p> Supercomputers and computers can both be fan-cooled and water-cooled although Supercomputers tend to be more water-cooled and there are very little fan-cooled supercomputers </p>
		<p> &nbsp; </p>
		</div>
		<div id="difference">
		<h2> Differences </h2>
		<p> Normal Computers have 1 CPU which is usually have 2 - 4 cores while a Supercomputer can have thousands of CPU's and even more cores </p>
		<p> A normal computer can take around a couple feet worth of space (depending on how many monitors you are using), but a supercomputer usually takes up a whole room. </p>
		<p> Supercomputer can also be cooled by refrigeration which means it is put into a room at very low temperture so the computer doesn't get too hot. </p>
		<p> Most Supercomputer runs Linux while most computer run either the Mac and the Windows OS </p> 
		<p> Supercomputers do more advanced calculation and process alot more data than a regular computer </p>
		</div>
		<div id="conclusion">
		<h2> Conclusion </h2>
		<p> In all, I've learned that both computers and supercomputer have the same computer parts. Each of the individual parts do their own role such as the PSU powering the whole computer, the CPU controling 
		and telling the computer what to do, the GPU which does calculation to show graphics along with doing calculation for the CPU, the Computer case helps protect all of the other computer parts from external 
		threat, the Motherboard connects all of the computer parts together, the Optical drive allows for external storage and allows the transfer of data from one computer to another via external object, The RAM/Memory 
		is where data that is currently being used is stored for quick access, the Hard-drive is the primary storage of a computer and is where all files are stored that isn't being used.</p>
		<p>I also learned that supercomputer and computer are not that different from each other. A supercomputer is just a regular computer that just has more of everything which makes it so much more powerful, but the same 
		time makes it cost alot more and uses alot more electricity. </p>
