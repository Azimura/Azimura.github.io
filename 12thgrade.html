		<h2> Greatest Growth Page </h2>
		<h3> Greatest Growth Statement </h3>
		<p> I have attended the Dayton Regional STEM School (DRSS) since 6th grade and I can say for sure that I have learned and grown a lot since the beginning of my time at the school. 
		However, if I were to point out one thing that I grew the most in, it would be my ability to communicate and express myself properly. Toward the beginning of my time at DRSS, I was very shy and could barely hold a conversation.
		I had very poor communication skills which led to alot of struggles throughout the first few years of my time at DRSS. However, over time through various projects, classes, and events, I was able to slowly communicate better and be able to effectively present my thoughts.
		The ability to communicate properly will be imperative to me as I head towards my future because proper communication is key for success in any field of work especially the one that I am going into which is computer programming. </p>
