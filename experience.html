		<h2> Programming/Coding </h2>
		<p> I enjoy programming/coding alot. I believed I got really into coding back in 8th grade when we were coding our portfolio, and ever snice then I knew that I wanted to have a career that had to deal with computer science or programming.
			I know how to code in 3 different languages HTML CSS, and Batch scripting, and I am learning how to code in both JavaScript and Python. During my highschool year, I took part in a Game Design class where I learned how to program in Unreal Engine 4. I also took a computer programming class where I learned how to program in Java

		<h2> CyberPatriot </h2>
		<p> CyberPatriot is a yearly competition that is created by the AFA. CyberPatriot is a competition where students will form teams and compete against other teams throughout the nation to see who could make a computer/network more "secure".
			I joined our school's CyberPatriot program when I was in 8th grade. I formed a team with 4 other people, and in that team I was the Windows specialist. Being the Windows specialist, I had to learn a lot about 
			the many settings in most of the Windows operating system. These include, Windows 10, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016. In addition to learning about the operating system, I had to learn about the security settings of
			many programs such as Firefox, Internet Explorer 11, and FileZilla. I also learned about batch scripting, which is a coding language used to change Windows Setting via command prompt. During my 8th grade year, My team was able to place 1st out of 8 middle school teams in Ohio and
			21st out of 2,000 middle school teams in the nation. In my 9th grade year, My team was able to place 2nd place highschool team in Ohio in the gold tier, and during the semifinals we were beat the other highschool team in Ohio and placed 8th out of nation in the  gold tier. During my 10th grade year, I had joined a new team and we were slotted into the platinum tier where we had placed first in state during the state round and 32nd nationally out of 221 Platinum teams.
			During my 11th grade year, we had a similar preformance to that of our 10th grade year. We were placed into the platinum tier and won first in state during the 3rd round, and then we placed 39th in the nation out of 917 platinum tier teams.

		<h2> MathCounts </h2>
		<p> MathCounts was a program for middle schoolers, where we would solve more complex math problems that we would not be solving in a normal math class. Then the school would have a competition to select 10 students to go to the regional competition to competea
			agsinst other school. I joined my MathCounts program when I was in the 6th grade, and during my 8th grade year, I was able to placed 5th in my school competition and I placed 21st in the regional competition out of 100 students. During my 9th grade year,
			I became a coach for MathCounts and I helped the middle schoolers with any troubles that they had while solving the problems.

		<h2> Terracycle </h2>
		<p> I was also in our schools Green Team. Green Team is a club created by Mr. Nelson where we would go around the school to help our school become a more sustainable place while also helping our custodians. While I was in Green Team, I helped with the Terracycle group.
			In Terracycle, we would collect the trash bags from the Terracycle bin and brought them back into Mr.Nelson's (now Ms.Carter's) classroom. 
			Then we would sort out the terracycle into 6 different categories. These categories include juice pouches, chip bags, garnola bars, gogo squeezes, little bites, and peronal hygine. To figure out if something could be terracycled, we would check in the inside to see if it had foil lining.
			If it did, chances were that it could be terracycled. After sorting everything, we would shipped out the things that could be terracycled.

		<h2> TNTT </h2>
		<p> For 8 years, I was apart of an youth organization at church called TNTT. In this youth organization, I learned more about god and how to life a good catholic life. Other things that I did were helping out around the church cleaning, cooking, and washing dishes. We also help set up for certain holidays such as the Lunar New Year, Mid-Autumm Festival, Christmas, etc.
			Within the group, I was a team lead. As team lead, I led various teams by planning for events, coming up with ideas during activity, and help look over the younger kids during times of break. I also particpated in various skits and dances during many of the yearly festivals.

		<h2> McDonald's </h2>
		<p> Towards the end of my 10th grade year, I got a job working at McDonald's. At McDonald's, I mainly work in the kitchen either on the grill, fried products, or table. Aside from my usual Kitchen, I help out around the store either cleaning the store or doing basic tasks that do not require much training.

		<h2> Esport </h2>
		<p> At the end of my 11th grade year, I had joined our school's newly "established" esports team. As a member of the valorant team, I am currently the IGL (In-game Leader) for the team. As IGL, I am the one making the calls within the team. Outside of games, I help our team schedule and set up our practices. I also do some individual VOD reviews and watch professional games in order to help me improve in my role.
