		<h2>Welcome to My Dayton Regional STEM School Portfolio </h2>
		<div class="image_right image_box">

		<p> Hello my name is Bryan Nguyen, I am a graduating senior at the <strong> Dayton Regional STEM School</strong>. At the Dayton Regional STEM School we learn about <b> STEM </b> 
		(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math), but we don't just only focus on STEM we also learn about other stuff like Coding, History, and skills to help you in the future.
		We learn by using <strong> PBL </strong> (Project Based Learning) and in this portfolio website I will show you some of the projects that I did during my time at DRSS.
		</p>
		<h2> Teachers </h2>
		<p> The teachers here at the Dayton Regional STEM School are some of the best teachers I have had the pleasure of meeting. They care a lot about their students and they all genuinely enjoy having fun with their students.
		This may be due to the PBL style of teaching that the school uses,but no matter what time of day the teachers are ready to help their students with any struggle they have and most will
		even stay after school to meet with the students to make sure that everyone is caught up and help any students struggling with anything. </p>
		<h2> ACE Culture </h2> 
		<p> At the Dayton Regional STEM School we have something called ACE Culture. ACE stands for Accepting Culture for Everyone, and every year during February our school has a week called ACE week where throughout
		the whole entire week we learn about other cultures and about our peers through activities during lunch or advisory. An important event that happens during ACE week is Culture Fest. Culture Fest is an event that happens during the afternoon
		where students who volunteer would create a presentation about a certain countries culture that they know a lot about whether it be a country that they came from or a country that they had recently visited. </p>

		<h2> Growth Mindset!</h2>
