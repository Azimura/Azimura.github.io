	<h2> Process of coding </h2>
	<p> During my time coding in the 8th grade I haven't really struggle that much to the point where I was really stressed out. There were still those times where I didn't know why my code wasn't working but I 
	eventually resolved it. I also didn't really have many moments of success during coding but if I had to say one then it was when I was able to make the code that allowed me to switch between 2 different style 
	sheet at anything without actually changing the code of the website.</p>
