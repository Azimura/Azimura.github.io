		<h2> Storybook </h2>

			<p>Whenever my mom looks at my drawing she always laughs. For example one time when I brought home my Lab Safety poster home and showed to my mom she laughed so hard that she told my brother about it and he even laughed. Then she told my cousin who also laughed at me and sooner or later my whole family was laughing. During that time I did not have that much of a creative mind, which meant that I also did not have that much creativity. Creativity just means to have a mindset to think outside the box or thinking about things in a way that most people do not think about it. For most people, including myself we go through a part of our lives where we were horrible at drawing. If I have to be honest to myself I am still pretty bad at drawing. However this year I have grown in my ability to draw on the computer because I have grown in creativity.
			<br />
			Throughout the 7th grade, I have grown a lot in creativity but one project that really helped me was the Storybook project. In this project, I had to work with Raleigh Tutt to make a picture book that talked about conflict resolution strategies so that it appeals to young kids. This project was done in STEM Foundation, Wellness and Fitness, and Language Art. During this project, I had to draw in Adobe Illustrator, which is a drawing program that makes vector based images. Vector based images use geometrical shapes to create images. The biggest challenge that I had during the time I was drawing was that my picture didn’t look good. You can tell this from my first draft of the 3rd page. There is not anything that looked diverse about it. I did not add any texture to the blocks, they look like geometrical shapes you see every day. The image was not that pleasing because I did not use the rule of thirds, which states that anything drawn on an imaginary grid that makes 9 squares out of your picture makes the image more pleasing. There were also a lot more negative space than positive space. Negative space is the space that art does not take up while positive space is the space in which art does take up. In a drawing, you want a balance of positive and negative space. However after making multiple drafts and having a creative mindset, which allowed me to think of unique shapes by changing the shapes of my old drafts and adding more detail to the rocks and the ground, I also had my partner and my peers critique my drafts and my pages progressed to look a lot better and it eventually looked really good which is seen on the final draft. The final draft shows that I followed the rule of thirds and that there is balance between negative and positive space. The ground and the rocks on the page has details to it now instead of being a square ground and a triangular rock.

			Through the Storybook project, I’ve grown in creativity which increased my computer drawing skills. I have always struggled in this area but the Storybook project helped me find out that if I wanted to get better at drawing in a computer or drawing in general, I would have to have a creative mindset which requires the quality of creativity. Creativity is important in life so that you can to do things that no one has ever thought of or to improve on things that is hard to improve on. Basically saying is that creativity can help you with whatever you do.

		<h2> Communicable Disease </h2>
			<p>Collaborating for me is hard because I’m shy to ask for help. One time, I was in a group and the part that I was supposed to do brought our grade down. I was an independent person during that time, so when we got together and put all of the pieces together for our final product my piece looked really bad. Collaboration means that you can work effectively in groups and not be afraid to ask your peers to help you. Collaboration is hard for some person either because they don’t know what to do in the groups, or they like to stuff alone. I’m still an independent person myself but I got a lot better at working in groups and asking for help. This year, I’ve grown in the quality of collaboration which has help me to become better at finding information 
			<br/>
			Throughout this year, there is a lot of time where I showed growth in collaboration but the project that really helped me improve was the Bulletin Board Project or the Communicable disease. In this Project, I had to work in a group of 3 people. I worked with John Schmenk, Patrick O’Conner, and myself. In this Project, we had to make a Bulletin Board about 4 of the many different types of communicable disease. Communicable diseases are diseases that can be transmitted from person to person, animal to person, and environment to person. During this project John and I were in charge of finding the information about the communicable disease. I had a lot of trouble finding my information because the websites that I was on kept repeating information from each other or didn’t give me the information I needed at all. I asked John for help finding the information and he gladly helped snice he was done. After a while of looking we found all of the remaining information. All the information that I found can be found on the organizer that we used to help us organize our information. The Organizer also helped us figure out information we are supposed to find. Our RAHAed paper also helped me a lot because due to that I found out what the information we were supposed to find means and how/where to find it, which made my research easier.
			<br/>
			Through the Bulletin Board project, I’ve grown in collaboration which has helped me to find information easier. I am not struggling when working in groups, it’s more I am too shy to ask my partner/peers for help. The Bulletin Board project really helped me build up my confidence to ask my peers for help which also has helped me grow in Collaboration. Collaboration helps you in life because when you grow up most job requires you to work in groups. When using Collaboration you will feel a lot less stress and also complete your work faster.
