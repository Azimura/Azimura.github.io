		<h2> Growth Statement </h2>
		<p>
		During my 11th grade year, I have grown all around from my personality, my mentality, and my knowledge. However, there is one area that I feel like I have grown the most in. That area is the ability to be independent.
		My 11th grade year was one of the toughest school years. With the Covid-19 pandemic that was happening at the time, most students were forced to learn virtually. This meant that communcation between students and teacher would be harder. This meant that 
		I was sometimes on my own in figuring questions out on my own. This reqiured me to figure out how to solve problems and research topics on my own.
