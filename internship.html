		<h2> Abstract </h2>
		<p>
		The purpose of this career exploration report was to explore two specific careers that was of interest as well as possible internships relating to those  careers. 
		The two careers chosen were computer programming and game designing/developing. The report contains essential questions asked while researching, two reports containing research on both careers,  four companies of interest that may be contacted for an internship, a rationale for what was concluded in the form of a reflection, and a logbook detailing the changes made to the report.
		The information that has been gathered in this report came from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ONET, Indeed, Road Trip Nation, Learn How To Become, the New England Institute of Technology, and GameDesigining. 
		After researching, it is concluded  that a career as a game developer will be  the primary focus with a career as a computer programmer as backup. 
		In high school, contact with computer programming companies will be made in order to line up an internship. In college, a degree in computer science will be pursued.

		<h2> Internship </h2>
		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		<p> At the Dayton Regional STEM School, students are required to complete a 72 hour internship at a chosen location between their junior year and the beginning of their senior year. Throughout their junior year, students will attend various events and conduct research on potential intership locations. Students will then reach out to potential companies on their interest in interning at said company. The goal of the internship assignment is to help students gain real world experience while also helping them learn more about the choices they will want to make in the future.
		<h3> Daily Blogs </h3>
		<h3> 5/13 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> In the morning, I spent most of my time playing around with unreal engine 4’s advanced vehicle blueprint. The main goal of this task was to get myself used to the base blueprints of the advanced vehicle template and figure out how everything is coded. In the afternoon, Jack introduced our group of interns (mostly students from STEM) to rocket league (something similar to car soccer) replica project which would be the project that we would be working on for the next two weeks. Our task would be to create cars that we would then put into a level that the GRILL made. Then we would compete against each other in a friendly match of rocket league.</p>

		<h3> 5/14 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> In the morning I got put into the “team” that I was going to be working with for this project. Within the team, we are supposed to help each other with our projects and then compete together during the competition against other team. After getting put into my team, I spent most of the day creating a basic ability for my car. In the afternoon, Jack had a few lessons for us to show us how to do some basic mechanics such as speeding up and homing missiles. </p>

		<h3> 5/17 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today I continued to work on my car by adding some new materials to my car (a light blue color that glows) and a fire trail, I also continued working on my cars ability to get it to work the way I wanted. In the afternoon, Jack taught us how set up our blueprint so that it would compatible with multiplayer play. </p>

		<h3> 5/18 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today was testing day for us. We had imported our cars into the server and were testing to see if our cars were working properly. I ran into a few problems with my car, but most of them were minor problems. In the afternoon, I spent most of my time fixing all of the problems that I found during testing. I also spent the remaining time implementing a new ability which was a self-destruct. </p>

		<h3> 5/19 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today I spent my time importing some new models into unreal, finishing and fixing my abilities, and testing. The new model I had imported into unreal was a dog model that I was going to use to replace my base car model. I had also created a new ability that would allow me to knock other cars up around my car. </p>

		<h3> 5/20 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today I spent most of my time testing, fixing my abilities, and changing my model. I had done some testing yesterday and found a couple of bugs. Firstly, my clones would not explode on contact with something. Secondly, the way my car moves and interacts with other cars was bugged. It would flip over constantly and would not collide with other cars properly. </p>

		<h3> 5/21 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today I spent most of time troubling shooting and bug fixing the two major bugs that I had. The majority of my time was spent trying to get my car to properly move and collide with objects while not flipping over or moving at 1 mph. </p>

		<h3> 5/24 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today I spent the morning testing out my fixed car against my teammates and the opponents. Since this is the final day we had for testing, I focused on making sure that all of the basic function of my car worked and that it was balanced relative to other player’s cars. In the afternoon, I mainly focused on making balance changes to my car so that the competition tomorrow would not be so one sided. </p>

		<h3> 5/25 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p>Today was competition day. We started out the morning completing matches in a way that every team faced each other once. Then the teams would be sorted into a double elimination bracket. My team had won the most matches during the morning so we had gotten a bye during the bracket stage. In the bracket stage, we won against the “Dragon Bois” twice to win the whole tournament </p>

		<h3> 5/26 (8 hours)</h3>
		<p> Today was a chill and relax day for us. In the morning, we played some more friendly matches between teams. We also made the cars insanely broken for both fun and to see what would happen if the cars were not balanced. In the afternoon, we had a party and played some other games such as beat saber and smash. </p>

		<h3> Reflection </h3>
		<p text-indent="20px"> During my 2020 – 2021 schoolyear, I participated in an internship at the GRILL (Gaming Research Integration for Learning Laboratory) instead of doing the school’s typical end of the year STEMmerision. At the GRILL, I worked with a group of seniors (then juniors) from my school to create a clone of rocket league. The whole goal of our internship was to create custom cars in unreal and then we would import those cars (alongside any code that comes with the car) into one big unreal file that the GRILL had created and we would play soccer with them. </p>
		<p> Throughout my time at the GRILL, I had to overcome many different obstacles and struggles. The main struggle that I had when creating my car was trying to get the car to properly move. The main problem with how I had created my car was that I had put the model that I wanted to use as my “car” on top of the actual car that I would be controlling. This caused a problem since both models had their own individual collisions and both needed those collision to be enabled to work properly. To avoid confusion, I will be calling these models the design model and the driving model, respectively. The design model had to have collision so that when I bumped into other cars I would collide using the collision of the design model not the collision of the driving model. The driving model had to have collision so that the car would properly drive. Without proper collision, the car would either fall through the map or would not drive at all since driving was physics based and physics needed collision to work. To fix this issue, I had to do a lot of guess and check with the how the models were to interact with one another. In the end, what I did to fix this issue was to change the item type of driving model from vehicle to pawn. Then I changed the collision of both models to ignore each other i.e. the design model would ignore all pawns while the driving model would ignore all vehicles. That was not the only problem that I had with making the car work properly. The second problem that I had was how my car was balanced. When choosing my design model, I created a model that looked similar to a Beyblade. The problem with this design was the if I were to drive too quickly or if I were to collide with something then the car would become off balanced and flipped over. To rectify to issue, I made the base of the car to be bigger while the top of the model to smaller. Overall, the greatest struggle that I had during my internship at the GRILL was making my car move and work properly. </p>
		<p> During my time at the GRILL, I have learned how to use various software in order to aid me in my task. The primary piece of software that I used was Unreal Engine 4. Unreal Engine 4 is a popular game engine created by Epic Games. Game engines is a basic software framework that game developers use to create video games. While I had prior experience using Unreal Engine 4, my time with the GRILL allowed me to have a deeper understanding of unreal especially when it comes to making the game multiplayer compatible. I had also gotten a chance to have at unreal’s particle and texture/material system. Aside from Unreal Engine 4, I also got a chance to use 3D modeling software such as Blender to create models for our car. While I personally did not use a self-created model in my final car, I did want to play around in Blender a bit since I had used 3DS Max as my primary 3D modeling software and wanted to see if Blender would be a better software for me. Personally, I felt that using Blender was very uncomfortable, but it could just be because I was used to 3DS Max. </p>
		<p> My internship at the GRILL has taught me a lot about the work environment of a game developer. The internship allowed me to experience what a game developer would do on an average day. This information will be invaluable to me as in the future I want to become a game developer and this experience will allow me to have a better understanding of the environment and lifestyle that I will have if I choose to continue pursuing a career in game development. Overall, I have learned that a game developer average day can be pretty mundane and boring at times but can also be very eventful especially when making a lot of progress in a certain task/objective. </p>
		<p> Overall, I have learned a lot throughout my internship at the GRILL. I have learned about the programs that I will have to use in the industry, skills and qualities that I will need within this field, and the environment in which I be in if I decide to pursue a career within game development. The skills and information that I have learned through this internship will help me in deciding my future and well as aiding me in my endeavors that I will partake in. </p>
